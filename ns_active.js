/*
 ***** ACTIVE SUBDOMAINS (NS records)
 * ***********************
 *
 * This list contains NS records in extension to the list of active CNAMEs in this repository.
 *
 * Second level NS records makes it possible for subdomain owners to redirect to another DNS provider.
 * This option has potential security issues (e.g. if you use another DNS provider to add MX records to route your email traffic)
 * and is only meant for advanced users. 
 *
 * You should avoid this option if you only want a JS.ORG subdomain!!!
 * FYI: https://github.com/js-org/js.org/issues/2890
