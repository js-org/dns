**To get a short and sleek subdomain for your own GitHub Page follow these 4 Steps:**

### Step 1
If you haven't already, now it's time to log in to your GitHub account and set up your GitHub Page following the instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/). To get a head start you can simply use the generator with one of the provided themes and **add some reasonable content to your new page**.

### Step 2
Now determine your js.org subdomain: either choose your username or the name of your repo according to the existing GitHub Pages URL (for ```http://foo.github.io/bar```, either ```foo.js.org``` or ```bar.js.org``` would be possible). More details in the [wiki](https://github.com/js-org/dns/wiki).

### Step 3
Add a file named ```CNAME``` to your repo (in the ```gh-pages``` branch for project pages) with a single line matching the domain you have chosen (e.g. ```foo.js.org```). If you prefer a webinterface form, have a look at [GitHub Pages Help](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/).

### Step 4
To finish the procedure, make a pull request in this GitHub repository that adds your subdomain to the [list](https://github.com/js-org/dns/blob/master/cnames_active.json) of existing JS.ORG domains. Your new URL should go live within 24 hours (keep an eye on your pull request in case of a naming conflict).

### CloudFlare
JS.ORG uses CloudFlare as its DNS. If enabled, CloudFlare proxies all requests to your subdomain to get SSL support (https://foo.js.org) and make use of browser caching with a TTL of 30 min. But you can opt out from this and make CloudFlare forward all requests directly to GitHub. Just add `"cf": false` to the domain record.

### File format
```
{
	"subdomain": {"cname": "foo.github.io", "cf": true}
}
```

### Restricted subdomains
For the moment the following subdomains are restricted.
The list is not necessarily complete and could be extended at some point.

Some of these subdomains are reserved for JS.org itself (e.g.: `mail.js.org`, `admin.js.org`).
Others are so generic that they should be used for community driven pages only (e.g.: `blog.js.org`, `docs.js.org`).
If you are willing to use one of the restricted subdomains in a way the community can benfit and participate, you can always file an issue and start a discussion.
